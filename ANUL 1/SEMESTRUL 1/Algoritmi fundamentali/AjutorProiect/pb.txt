1. You are a poor person in ChocoLand. Here, people eat chocolates daily instead of normal food.
 There is only one shop near your home; this shop is closed on Sunday, but open on all other days of 
the week. You may buy at most one box of N chocolates from this shop on each day when it is open.

Currently, it's Monday, and you need to survive for the next S days (including the current day). You
 have to eat K chocolates everyday (including the current day) to survive. Do note that you are 
allowed to buy the a chocolate box and eat from it on the same day.

Compute the minimum number of days on which you need to buy from the shop so that you can survive the
 next S days, or determine that it isn't possible to survive.

2.Chef has decided to move on in life and forget his last girlfriend. He has decided to get rid of
all the love letters which he had received from his girlfriend by burning them. But he can burn the 
letters only when he is alone at home. 

Chef has a total of N love letters which he had received from his girlfriend and he is alone at home 
for S hours. Each love letter depending on the length and paper it is made up of takes time b minutes 
to burn. Even though Chef is sad but he’s concerned about the environment too. Therefore he want’s to 
burn the minimum possible letters so as to last for S hours.

If the love letters burn for exact S hours then print the number of love letters which are burned, 
if the letters burn for less than S hours then print the total number of minutes for which the
 letters burn,which happens in case Chef runs out of letters. However, if the letters burn for more 
than S hours then print the minimum number of letters burned and the minimum time in minutes for
 which the fire burns for after S hours.
