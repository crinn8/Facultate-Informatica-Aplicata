Given a list of strings where no string is substring of another, find a shortest string that contains
 each string in given list as a substring.

Given a source vertex s from set of vertices V in a weighted graph where all its edge weights w(u, v) 
are non-negative,
 find the shortest-path weights d(s, v) from given source s for all vertices v present in the graph.
